Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP:


Classes and Objects:
Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
Objects are instances of classes.


Defining a Class:
class ClassName {
    // Properties and Methods
}
Creating Objects:
$object = new ClassName();


Accessing Properties and Methods:
$object->property;
$object->method();


Constructor and Destructor:
__construct(): Called when an object is created.
__destruct(): Called when an object is destroyed.


Inheritance:
Inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
Use extends keyword.


Visibility:
public: Accessible from anywhere.
protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
private: Accessible only within the class.


Static Properties and Methods:
Belong to the class itself, not objects.
Accessed using :: operator.


Abstract Classes and Interfaces:
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
Interfaces define contracts for implementing classes.


Traits:
Group reusable methods.
Use use keyword to include in a class.


OOP promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability in PHP.
